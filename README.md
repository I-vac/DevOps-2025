## 🌟 **Project Overview**
ITU-MiniTwit is a micro-blogging platform that allows users to:
- Register and manage accounts.
- Post short messages (tweets).
- Follow and unfollow other users.
- View personal and public timelines.

This project includes:
- A **web application** for user interaction.
- A **simulator API** to emulate user behavior and load.
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing, building, and deployment.

## ✨ **Features**
✅ User Registration & Login  
✅ Secure password hashing with BCrypt  
✅ Post and view messages  
✅ Follow/Unfollow users  
✅ Personal and public timelines  
✅ Real-time data updates through shared database  
✅ Full CI/CD pipeline with automated weekly releases

```
- **Web App:** User interface to interact with the platform.  
- **Simulator API:** Simulates user interactions like tweeting and following.  
- **Database:** Shared SQLite database to synchronize data between the web app and simulator.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Handles build, test, release, and deployment stages automatically.

## 🖥️ **Setup & Installation**
### Prerequisites:
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Java 17 & Maven  
- GitHub account for CI/CD integration  

### 🚀 Quick Start:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/itu-minitwit.git
   cd itu-minitwit
   ```
2. Build and run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the app:
   - Web Application: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  
   - Simulator API: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)  

---

## 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**
We use **GitHub Actions** for our CI/CD setup. Key stages include:
- **Build:** Compiles the Java application and builds Docker images.
- **Test:** Runs unit and integration tests.
- **Release:** Weekly automatic releases every Friday at 12:00 UTC.
- **Deploy:** Pushes images to Docker Hub and deploys to production servers.

👉 **Why GitHub Actions?**  
- Fully integrated with GitHub  
- Free for public repositories  
- Extensive community support  
- Simple YAML configuration  

For detailed pipeline configuration, check out the [`ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) file.

---

## 🎮 **Simulator Integration**
The **Simulator API** runs on port `5001` and interacts with the main application to:
- Register users  
- Post messages  
- Follow and unfollow users  

Why a simulator?  
✅ Load testing  
✅ Behavior simulation for active timelines  
✅ Real-time monitoring via the web interface  

---

## 🚢 **Deployment & Releases**
- **Weekly automated releases** are created on GitHub.  
- Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub.  
- Production deployment is automated via SSH and Docker Compose.
